## Menu Management System ##

## Overview ##

This project is a Node.js backend server designed to manage a hierarchical menu system. The menu is divided into three levels: Categories, Subcategories, and Items. Each level has specific attributes and relationships, and the server provides full CRUD operations for each. The API can be tested using Postman.

## Features ##

•	Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for Categories, Subcategories, and Items.

•	Search functionality to find items by their name.

•	Hierarchical structure: Categories contain Subcategories, and Subcategories contain Items.

•	Tax management: Manage tax applicability and tax rates at each level.

## Technology Stack ##

•	Node.js and Express.js: For server-side logic and API creation.

•	MongoDB (with Mongoose): For data storage and management.

•	dotenv: For environment variable management.

•	Nodemon: For easier development with auto-reloading.

## Getting Started ##
